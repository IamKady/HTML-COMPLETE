    <b>Third equation of motion</b><br><p> The third equation of motion relates an object's final velocity (v), initial velocity (u), acceleration (a), and displacement (s). The equation is as follows: </p><br>
    <p>

       v2 = u2 + 2as

    </p>
    <p>

     v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as

    </p>

     v<sub>2</sub> = u<sub>2</sub> + 2as
